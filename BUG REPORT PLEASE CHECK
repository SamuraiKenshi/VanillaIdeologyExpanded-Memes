I found bug but I can't post in on steam page because I don't have rimworld on steam account.
It happens only with this mod, so whenever I right click any table with bills or storage like deep storage it gets massive lag and freeze for few seconds and all recipes and menus are lagging like crazy.
I can solve problem by removing from leader (best fighter) his role or removing a pawn that is a leader from my ideology...
